                    The U.S. Department of Education’s National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research has recently announced funding for one of the projects that Floe is participating in: "Profile Creation Support for Cloud-based Accessibility." This project will harness global networks and cloud services to support custom preferences that travel with a learner across devices and learning environments, both on and off the Web, delivering appropriate solutions to users anywhere, anytime and on any device or platform. The contract for this project was awarded to the <a href="http://www.iskme.org/">Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education</a> (ISKME), in partnership with the <a href="http://gpii.net/">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure</a> (GPII) team, including the <a href="http://idrc.ocadu.ca">Inclusive Design Research Center</a> at OCAD U, <a href="http://raisingthefloor.org/">Raising the Floor International</a>, <a href="http://ncam.wgbh.org/">WGBH’s National Center for Accessible Media</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a>, and <a href="http://inclusive.com/">Inclusive Technologies</a>.
