                    The <a href="http://cisl.cast.org/">Center on Inclusive Software for Learning</a> (CISL) is creating a suite of innovative tools to create, discover and use accessible, adaptable digital learning resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Led by <a href="http://www.cast.org/">CAST</a> and funded by the U.S Department of Education's <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/">Office of Special Education Programs</a>, the CISL suite will make digital educational materials accessible, flexible, and engaging for all students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Floe project is working as a partner on the CISL project to integrate Floe tools such as <a href="https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/">Learner Options</a> into the <a href="http://cisl-demo.cast.org/index-readium.html?pub=serp-paper-or-plastic">CISL Reader</a> and other parts of the software suite, and to apply its principles of inclusive design for learning.
                </p>
