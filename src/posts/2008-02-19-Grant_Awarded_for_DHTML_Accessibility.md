                    <p>The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto has received a grant from the Mozilla Foundation to promote DHTML accessibility and the adoption of ARIA (the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative&#39;s Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification).</p>
<p>The Fluid project will participate in this work, which will involve evangelism, mentoring, community-building, and technical leadership. One of the key contributions will be to work with the jQuery community to implement ARIA support in this popular toolkit. </p>
