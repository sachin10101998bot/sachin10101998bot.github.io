                <p>
                    As part of an effort to include diverse perspectives in the creation of inclusive
                    cities, the IDRC and Floe organized co-design sessions in elementary and
                    middle schools with students in Grades 3, 5, and 6. The co-design activity was developed
                    in collaboration with classroom teachers and parents to tailor the activity to
                    the interests and needs of the children. A
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXPRpp6oafkjaGrcbp4RcVFf3mumyk7dQorMY9_zLhc/edit">facilitation OER </a>
                    was created which includes instructions for several city design activities.

                    The design process included giving students blank cards to add their own features
                    to their neighbourhood which resulted in the inclusion of religious centres, airports,
                    banks, gyms, and stadiums. The overarching themes that emerged from the co-design
                    sessions show that environmental friendliness, accessibility, and inclusivity of
                    neighbourhoods were important factors for students in all three grades.
