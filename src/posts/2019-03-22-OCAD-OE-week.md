                    Moderated by Floe team member Jess Mitchell of the <a href="https://idrc.ocadu.ca/">Inclusive Design Research Centre</a>, the panel event brought together a diverse range of speakers from inside and outside OCAD University to talk about openness, education and innovation.

                    Another Floe team member, IDRC developer &amp; researcher Alan Harnum, particularly liked panelist Amy Buckland's point that the long-term sustainability of open educational resources is closely tied to their accessibility and inclusion:
