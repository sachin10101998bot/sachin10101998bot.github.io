                    <p>The Fluid team is using UX (user experience) walkthroughs of target applications to identify &quot;pain points&quot; encountered by users.</p>
<p>As the primary goal of Fluid is to improve the user&rsquo;s experience, we plan to apply recognized and formally constituted methods to identify problems and prioritize improvements. With this in mind, at the very beginning of the project, we started defining and documenting a step-by-step UX walkthrough process &ndash; a combination of usability and accessibility heuristic evaluations with cognitive walkthroughs &ndash; and are now putting this into practice with Sakai and uPortal as our first subjects.</p>
<p>We welcome volunteers! If you are interested in helping, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Join the Sakai, Moodle, or uPortal <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups">working groups</a> and help out with the walkthroughs themselves. </li>
    <li>Improve the <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Experience+Walkthroughs">UX Walkthrough area</a> of our wiki as it is in need of organization and consolidation. If you&rsquo;ve got time for some quick editing and re-organization, please feel free! <br />
    </li>
    <li>Share your accessibility expertise and advice with the <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups">working groups</a>.</li>
</ul>
