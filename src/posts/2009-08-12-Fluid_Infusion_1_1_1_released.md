                    <p>Infusion 1.1.1 is here! This release is a maintenance release, which means no new features were added but several bugs were fixed for our Inline Edit and Reorderer components. Infusion 1.1.1 is an incremental upgrade and preserves backwards compatibility for all production-grade components.</p>

   <li>
<a style="" href="/browse/FLUID-1320">Typing &quot;Click here to edit&quot; is equivalent to erasing all the text</a>
    </li>

   <li> <a   href="/browse/FLUID-2967">Item will drop to the right of an element when it should have dropped at the left.</a></li>

<h3>What is Fluid Infusion?</h3>

<p>Fluid Infusion is an application framework for building usable and accessible user interfaces with JavaScript. Built on top of jQuery, Infusion takes a different approach to client-side development. At heart, Infusion is an open architecture designed to put you back in control of your application’s user experience. It includes a growing collection of UI components—reusable interactions that go deeper than most widgets. Created by a community of developers and interaction designers, Infusion components are built from the ground up with accessibility in mind. All of our designs can be used with assistive technologies, are fully controllable with the keyboard, and can be transformed to suit your users’ personal needs.</p>
<p>Fluid Infusion includes a collection of our UI components, tutorials to help you get started, solid APIs to help you dive in, and the community to lend a hand.</p>
