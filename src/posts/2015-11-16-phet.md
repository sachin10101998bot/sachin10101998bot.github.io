                <p>Floe is working with <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET</a>
                    to improve the accessibility of their free, open, interactive physics simulations. Over the past
                    year, we have contributed research, ideas, and evaluations for improvements to two of PhET's simulations:
                    <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Forces+and+Motion+Simulation+Design">Forces and Motion Basics</a> and
                    <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Simulation+Design">John Travoltage</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PhET team has been working to incorporate our input into a development version of the
                    <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?accessibility&screens=1">Forces and Motion: Basics</a>
                    simulation, and is now conducting user tests. Implementation of the new designs for the John Travoltage simulation is planned for December 2015.

                    From this collaboration with PhET, a guide "<a href="http://handbook.floeproject.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html">Web Games and Simulations</a>" has been added to the <a href="http://handbook.floeproject.org/">Inclusive Learning Design Handbook</a> to help educators create more inclusive and accessible web games and educational simulations.
