Fluid's first UI component, the Lightbox, has been built and was demonstrated at the June 2007 Sakai conference in Amsterdam and at the JA-SIG conference in Denver.
The Lightbox allows users to re-organize images within a collection by dragging-and-dropping thumbnails. The Lightbox is fully keyboard accessible, providing non-mouse users with a direct and convenient way of re-ordering images with the arrow keys. Part of the Sakai Image Gallery Tool, the Lightbox is the first instance of Fluid's reusable drag-and-drop accessibility library, which can be used by developers to implement a wide range of user interfaces in which the user can directly manipulate and re-order objects on-screen.
Detailed <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Lightbox+Component">technical and design documentation</a> for the Lightbox is available. See also, the <a href="http://confluence.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/CONF07/An+Introduction+to+the+FLUID+Project">slides from the Fluid presentation</a> given at the Sakai conference.
