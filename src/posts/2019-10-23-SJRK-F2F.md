                <p>
                    On October 17th, the
                    <a href="https://www.sojustrepairit.org/">Social Justice Repair Kit</a>
                    project met to reflect on the past three years of work. Participants created
                    <a href="http://stories.sojustrepairit.org/">stories</a>
                    to capture their experiences on the project. Highlights included training
                    youth to lead environmental protection work and doing audio-visual workshops
                    with youth at the margins, enabling them to not only tell their stories but
                    also to capture and present them in ways they want to.

                    At the end of the day, the project team created a collaborative surprise drawing which represents
                    the creative collaborations that happened throughout the project.
