                    In October the IDRC participated in a three-day hackathon in San Francisco focused on aligning
                    primary and secondary curriculum in crisis contexts.

                        Camp and Dadaab Refugee Camp share their on-the-ground experiences with the team. Images on the
                        screens behind the panel show the size of classes at refugee camps.

                    October’s event followed a series of previous consultations over several years, including sessions
                    at the <a href="https://www.wise-qatar.org">WISE Summit</a> and in
                    <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ke/kakuma-refugee-camp">Kakuma Refugee Camp</a>, which culminated
                    this past March with a design sprint in Paris the IDRC participated in. The
                    <a href="https://blog.learningequality.org/report-release-design-sprint-on-curriculum-alignment-in-crisis-contexts-57eb717b9e7e">Paris sprint</a>
                    developed a proof-of-concept for open-source software tools to make the process of curriculum
                    alignment easier and faster—recognizing and designed to support the role of human curators—usable by
                    a variety of platforms and projects.

                    In crisis contexts, there is a need to quickly categorize and align digital materials to reduce
                    friction in the adoption of educational technology. While there is an abundance of open educational
                    resources, they are not often categorized against different national systems or are not organized in
                    a way that facilitates self-guided discoverability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The IDRC contributed to the development of a rubric to help guide real-world judgements for the
                    process of curriculum alignment with a feedback loop to continue to build inclusivity in judgements
                    and avoid reductive criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to embed an inclusive reality into judgements--to always ask who is not included at
                    every step of the process. Applying inclusive design means having diverse educators performing
                    alignment judgements, folks who have experience, including lived experience, with marginalized
                    learners and learning in a marginalized context. The diverse contributors then feed rich and diverse
                    adjustments back to the rubric.

                        alignment project.
