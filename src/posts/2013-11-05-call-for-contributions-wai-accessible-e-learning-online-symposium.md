                    Learning and education are the enablers of social and economic change. E-learning
                    systems allow instructors and students to interact synchronously and asynchronously
                    from any part of the world that has a viable internet connection. This symposium will
                    explore the relationship between content accessibility and interface accessibility,
                    accessibility of e-learning environments used in non-conventional contexts,
                    privacy issues in profiling learners and e-learning environments users, and other important topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participation in the symposium is free.
