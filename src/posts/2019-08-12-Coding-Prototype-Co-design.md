                    At the
                    <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2019/">ISTE 2019 conference</a>,
                    we shared a
                    <a href="https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/">coding environment prototype</a>
                    with educators interested in teaching coding skills to students
                    who are currently left out. We also gave a presentation entitled
                    <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2019/program/search/detail_session.php?id=112083158">Coding for All: Instruction That Includes Students With Special Needs</a>.

                    This summer, the project particpated in coding camps at
                    <a href="https://codelearncreate.ca/blog/co-design-session-1/">Kayla's Children Centre</a> and
                    <a href="https://codelearncreate.ca/blog/co-design-session-4/">Playful Strides</a>
                    where the prototype was used by students to create artworks. Campers
                    spent some of the day considering how to redesign the prototype and
                    their insight is being used to update this prototype and to create new ones.
