                <h3>Workshop: The Business Advantages of Making Special the Norm</h3>
                <time class="floe-date" datetime="2015-05-08">May 8, 2015</time>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.viscardicenter.org/services/nbdc/">National Business and
                    Disability Council (NBDC)</a> at <a href="http://www.viscardicenter.org/">The Viscardi Center</a>
                     is offering an educational online workshop to focus on designing for diversity.</p>
                <p>No one needs to point out that the current business climate is in a state of flux
                    and transformation. To thrive requires a good measure of agility, responsiveness,
                    continuous innovation and dynamic resiliency. These qualities are the by-products of
                    broadly diverse perspectives, skills, and approaches combined with the conditions
                    that foster their inclusion. Fortuitously, emerging technologies and associated
                    practices make it viable to move beyond mass design – in policy, communication,
                    product development, service, marketing, training and other business practices –
                    and make special the norm. If we proactively design for diversity we not only comply
                    with legislative requirements for accessibility but we also reap the benefits of
                    flexibility, adaptability and a spectrum of possible approaches, to thrive in a
                    quickly evolving business climate.</p>
