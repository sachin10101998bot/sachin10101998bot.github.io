Last week, Fluid Project board member Jens Haeusser, from the University of British Columbia, came to Toronto to meet with the ATRC team. Prior to his current position as Director of Strategy in the Information Technology department at UBC, Jens was UBC's Information Security Officer.

Jens provided us with an update on UBC's plans for the [Kuali Student System](http://kuali.org/communities/ks/) and an overview of uPortal's security policies. We had some excellent discussions around security issues as they relate to the Fluid Project, and Jens helped us to draft a security policy for Fluid, which has been posted to the wiki: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Security.

We would very much like community input on this policy, so please have a look at the wiki page, and contribute your thoughts and comments.
