*[ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) hacking at OCAD University with Fluid.*

Last week the [IDRC](http://idrc.ocad.ca/) and Fluid team hosted an accessibility hackathon at OCAD University. The [jQuery UI blog](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/07/aria-hackathon-summary/) has a summary of what happened there! Thanks to everyone for a great event.
