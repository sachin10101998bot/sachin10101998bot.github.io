This blog entry is intended to be a discussion of implementing drag-and-drop with an eye towards accessibility.  However, putting the examples into this blog has proved challenging.  For the interim the article with examples is available via the following link: [Accessible Drag-and-drop Musings](http://clown.atrc.utoronto.ca/Fluid/AccessibleDnDMusings.html).

Feel free to discuss the topic here, however.
