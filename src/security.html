    <h2> Security and Privacy Architecture </h2>

    <p>The Floe Project is working with the
        <a href="http://gpii.net">Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure</a>
        to provide learners with friendly and comprehensive tools for sharing their data
        with the web sites, access features and assistive technologies that they trust.
        These tools will give learners complete control over which preferences are shared
        with any GPII-enabled services.</p>
    <p>For more information and to see an example of the security architecture in action,
        please see the video below.</p>
